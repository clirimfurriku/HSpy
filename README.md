# SIPHpy (Scan IP Headers Python)

Designed for termux (Android)

Scan IP adress Headers to find alive servers

This App is designed to scan for alive hosts on mobile operators with no active data plan. It can be used to find hosts that allow you to connect to the internet without a data plan (free). You should Google a bit if you don't know how to use alive Hosts to create payloads and connect to internet.

This is the fastest App out there for this specific search.

Install command:

pkg install wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clirimfurriku/SIPHpy/master/install.sh && bash install.sh

Stil has some bugs with multithreading when you scan too many IPs
